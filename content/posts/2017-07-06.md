# Notes

## Service Worker with React
I was able to simplify things by using `sw-precache` for the app shell and adding the optional setting of `runtimeCaching` for the blog section to use networkFirst.
```javascript
runtimeCaching: [
  {
    urlPattern: /\/blog.*/,
    handler: "networkFirst",
    options: {
      cache: {
        maxEntries: 10,
        name: "blog-cache"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Also had to add some more root globs for precaching as by default was only caching subfolder assets.
`gulpfile.js`
```javascript
staticFileGlobs: [
  rootDir + "/**/*.{js,html,css,png,jpg,gif,svg,eot,ttf,woff}", //gets subfolder assets
  rootDir + "/*.{js,html,css,png,jpg,gif,svg,eot,ttf,woff}" //caches root foler assets
],
```

I also had to put the registration for the service-worker in the `componentDidMount()`  function of the layout component since we only have access to the DOM once the component mounts. We need the DOM to access the `window.navigator` to register the service worker.
